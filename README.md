### Download
Precompiled builds of the command-line extraction utility (`hecl`) with embedded dataspec libraries are available at https://releases.axiodl.com. This will give you intermediate dumps of original formats as *blender* and *yaml* representations.

Everything else is much too experimental to make portable/stable release builds (for now)

### Platform Support
* Windows 7+ (64-bit support only)
* macOS 10.11+
* Linux
    * Arch is known to function with [`glx` vendor setup instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Graphics) *(main development/testing OS)*
    * **[WIP]** Vulkan loader detection is also integrated into the cmake for Linux
* **[Coming Soon]** FreeBSD
    * Much multimedia functionality is in place, but not fully tested
    
### Usage

* Extract ISO: `hecl extract [path].iso -o mp1`
  * `mp1` can be substituted with the directory name of your choice
* Repackage game for URDE: `cd mp1; hecl package`
* Run URDE: `urde mp1/out`

#### URDE options (non-exhaustive)

* `-l`: Enable console logging
* `--warp [worldid] [areaid]`: Warp to a specific world/area. Example: `--warp 2 2`
* `+developer=1`: Enable developer console

### Build Prerequisites:
* [CMake 3.13+](https://cmake.org)
    * For Windows: Install `CMake Tools` in Visual Studio
* [Python 3+](https://python.org)
    * For Windows: [Microsoft Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkID=2082640)
    * Verify it's added to `%PATH%` by typing `python` in `cmd`.
* LLVM development package *(headers and libs)*
    * [Specialized Windows Package](https://axiodl.com/files/LLVM-9.0.1-win64.exe)
    * [Specialized macOS Package](https://axiodl.com/files/LLVM-9.0.1-Darwin.tar.xz)
* **[Windows]** [Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)
    * Select `C++ Development` and verify the following packages are included:
        * `Windows 10 SDK`
        * `CMake Tools`
        * `C++ Clang Compiler`
        * `C++ Clang-cl`
* **[macOS]** [Xcode Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)
* **[Linux]** recent development packages of `udev`, `x11`, `xcb`, `xinput`, `glx`, `asound`

### Prep Directions

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AxioDL/urde.git
mkdir urde-build
cd urde-build
```

### Build Directions

#### ninja

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G Ninja ../urde
ninja
```

#### CMake options
- Build release optimized (better runtime performance): `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
- Use clang+lld (faster linking): `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++`
- Optimize for current CPU (resulting binaries are not portable): `-DURDE_VECTOR_ISA=native`

#### CLion
*(main development / debugging IDE)*

Open the repository's `CMakeLists.txt`.

Configure CMake options via `File` > `Settings` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `CMake`.

It's recommended to create a new `Toolchain` with `clang`/`clang++` and configure the CMake profiles to use it.

#### Qt Creator

Open the repository's `CMakeLists.txt` via File > Open File or Project.

Configure the desired CMake targets to build in the *Projects* area of the IDE.

Build / Debug / Run on Windows, macOS and Linux in a unified way.

#### Visual Studio

Verify all required VS packages are installed from the above **Build Prerequisites** section.

Open the `urde` directory in Visual Studio (automatically imports CMake configuration).

Follow [these instructions to use clang-cl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-cmake?view=vs-2019).
The build will **not** work with the normal VS compiler!

#### Xcode

```sh
cmake -G Xcode -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DLLVM_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-llvm-dev-package> ../urde
```

Then open `urde.xcodeproj`
